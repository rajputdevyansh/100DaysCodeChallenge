# 100 Days Of Code

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge!

For the next 100 days, I will be focusing on learning and improving my skills 
in Java and Python programming languages.
I will be updating this repository with my daily progress, including any projects or exercises I complete and any new concepts I learn.
I am excited for this journey and am determined to become a proficient developer in both Java and Python. 
In addition to my daily updates, I will also be setting personal goals for each week to ensure that I am constantly pushing myself to improve. These goals may include completing a certain number of exercises, or learning a specific concept or technique.

I am committed to dedicating at least an hour of coding every day for the next 100 days. I know that this will be a challenging but rewarding journey, and I am excited to see the progress I make in my Java and Python knowledge.
Stay tuned for daily updates on my progress and join me in this 100 Days ofÂ CodeÂ challenge!
